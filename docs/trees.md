# Trees

Our mod adds a few new trees, but as of 
now there hasn't been any custom woodsets yet.

Listed below are some trees you can find, and what they were supposed to resemble!

## Pine

You may mistake this tree for a fir at first, due to its appearance matching that of the Douglas Fir. However this pine resembles the Western White Pine, often found in mixed coniferous forests!

Where to find this tree:
- Meadows
- Taiga (Green variant in regular, Orange variant in Mega Taigas)
- Flower Forests

## Fir

These spruce like trees can be found all over the world and doesn't really follow any real life firs. It does have different coloured leaf variants to show off different 'seasons'.

Where to find this tree:
- Taiga
- Plains
