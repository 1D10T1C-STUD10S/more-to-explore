# Site Configuration

If you want to enable dark mode on this site, you may have to go through some additional proceedures in order to get dark mode enabled.

Since our sites **DO NOT** support dark mode yet, we have come up with some workarounds for now.

---

## Chrome users:

1. in the search bar type "chrome://flags/#enable-force-dark"
2. then under the dropdown, select "enable"
3. finally, hit the relaunch button
4. our site will now appear in dark mode

## Safari users:

Method 1:
Use the reader feature to get dark mode (the "Aa" button beside the search bar)

Method 2:
Use extentions to enable dark mode if method 1 fails or is not to your liking

## Samsung Internet users:

There is a built in "dark mode" option in the settings, enable it to get dark mode on the site.
