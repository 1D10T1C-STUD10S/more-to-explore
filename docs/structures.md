How difficulty is determined:
We tested the structure twice, once with netherite tools and armor and once with iron, then rated it based on how many times we struggled to beat the structure.

Don't expect to find all structures in a single playthrough (considering you don't play for 24 hours straight each time)

   Varying in size, they are crucial in completing storylines,
   best advised to avoid the structures unless it is part of the storyline you are    completing!
   As there is no indication of which structures are storyline structures, listed in    the page link above are all of them 

---

 - [Side Structures](https://1d10t1c-stud10s.github.io/more-to-explore/structures>side.html)

   Mostly small structures that are often generating near one another, containing early    game loot, some of which provide protection and shelter for the player.
   Not usually important but worth visiting at least once (please?)
