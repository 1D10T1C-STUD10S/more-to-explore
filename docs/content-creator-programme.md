# Partner Programme

All site owners and content creators!
Over here!

We understand if you'd like to use our mod for your videos/sites, and we have decided to come up with a plan to benefit both parties!

## Becoming an Offical Distributor [site owners of mod repost sites]

### What are the benefits?
- at the end of trailers, teasers on our YouTube channel, there will be a "get it here section" your site icon will be displayed there
- links to the page containing the mod will be displayed on this wiki

### What are the requirements?
- to become a partner, you must follow these steps:
  - you **must** give credit to us on the page (you get the clicks, we get the credit, fair?)
  - you **must** include a link back to the wiki site (so viewers can refer in case of confusion)
